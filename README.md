# AutoCAD-Programs
Vba and Lisp programs for AutoCAD to add some commands and functions.
# HOW TO USE
here are two lisp programs and other VBA programs which are interrelated.
* First of all make a vba project and import all .bas files.
* save that ass .dvb file.
* load that .dvb and Slim.lsp file into AutoCAD application. (you can also make them to always load)
* use the commands from .lsp file, which will in turn call the subroutines from the loaded .dvb file.
